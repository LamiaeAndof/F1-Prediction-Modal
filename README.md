## Project Overview:
As big data and AI students, our project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the winner of Formula 1 Grand Prix races. By analyzing a variety of factors, both present and historical, we aim to generate accurate predictions that can benefit Formula 1 enthusiasts, team managers, and fellow data lovers !. Through our  data analysis approach, we seek to uncover the key factors influencing race outcomes and provide insights into the potential range of race winners.

## Data Collection & Analysis:
We collected information for our research from a number of sources, including the Ergast Data repository, which has extensive historical Formula One data. A number of datasets were integrated, including qualification rankings, constructor standings, driver standings, race results, and weather data. We were able to learn more about circuit analysis, driver nationality, championship victories, and other important variables affecting driver and constructor success using exploratory data analysis. Understanding the sport and developing our modeling strategy required this insight.


## Machine Learning Models:
In order to have an accurate Formula One driver performance, we trained & compared multiple many machine learning models with other, Including support vector machines, random forests, logistic regression, and XGboost as our models. These models were chosen because they are well-liked in the machine learning field and are good at solving classification issues.


## Application of Machine Learning Models:
Using our trained models, we predicted the position of a certain player in a certain circuit giving us an approximative view of each players performance in different situations. We compared the performance of different models and selected the best one for our final predictions. To evaluate the models' performance, we employed cross-validation, which assesses how well a model can generalize to new data. 

## Tech Stack:
Several technologies and approaches were used in our study, such as data preparation, cleaning, transformation, feature selection, and model assessment. 

We trained the model using the Python programming language and popular tools such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation. To further convert numerical and categorical data into a format that worked with our machine learning models, we used feature engineering approaches.

for the front end part, Django was used
